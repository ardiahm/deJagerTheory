# deJagerTheory
A java program which prompts a user to input any positive real number (let's call it mu), then input 4 additional positive real numbers (called w, x, y, and z). Given an array of potential exponents (a, b, c, and d), the program will raise w, x, y, and z to the power of a, b, c, and d: guaranteeing the result is within 1% of the target number (mu).
